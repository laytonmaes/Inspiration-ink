### About the Project
Welcome to Inspiration Ink!

In this project I was set out to do two things: Create a functional app in roughly 5 days from start to finish, and to create an app that is important to me and serves a group that I am very proud to be a part of, namely Artists and Writers.

This application is built to provide a base that artists can use to knock themselves out of art block, create content online, or even just have a resource to easily practice in a way that facilitates automation.

I built the code for this application in roughly four days, with a couple days for planning. all in all, this application took about a week to complete. In this project, I utilized React and Cypress to build and test the application, as well as express to build a small restfull api.


## Application in Action

Upon loading the application, you will see a page displaying all of the avalable random art prompt generators.
You can click any of them to be brought to a screen that will load a randomly generated prompt on page load,or you can reroll until you find one that inspires you.
you can also go and add to a list of user generated art prompts via the "Submit Your Own Prompt" button.



 ## Potential Next Steps
 I worked for a while on building a database for this application that stored user submissions, but I just couldn't finish it in time for this projects turn in date, so that is a big one. i would also love to implement an NSFW filter on that so that users are moderated in what they can post.

 Better error handling, styling, and some descriptive text to better communicate to the user the purpose of everything in the app.

 i also want to build the logic for a character description generator and a better writing prompt generator.

 the final idea i had was a place where users could keep track locally of their progress, how many days in a row they have practiced their craft, save any prompts they particularly like, and maybe even have private prompts not shared to all users.
## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Express
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Cypress
- Webpack
- NPM
- Figma and Figjam

## Organizational Resources

This project utlizes a simple and concise [figjam board](https://www.figma.com/file/dgykmGcSugvLCJGqsawL1S/Inspiration-Ink?node-id=7%3A29) to create an intial project board during the planning phase.  

The I then used figma to design a [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/NwG0Kus2MMhyJsa1VHTEp3/Inspiration-Ink?node-id=1%3A2) for all of our different dashboard views. 

## Set Up
The details and setup of this project are outline in [this project spec](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

## Cypress Testing

We tested our application with Cypress for full E2E testing. To set up Cypress:
1. Cd into the inspiration-ink directory.
2. Run npm install -D cypress.
3. Then run npm run cypress
